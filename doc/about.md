## About this Server
This site is maintained by Matt Rude [0xE9FFC093FD113A2E](http://keyserver.mattrude.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xE9FFC093FD113A2E). If you would like to report any problems or bugs, please send a email to matt@mattrude.com, but only after reading our [FAQ](/doc/faq/).

This service may be withdrawn at any time and without notice to end-users. (Peers will be notified). End-users should use a pool definition, such as keys.gnupg.net which will alias into an operational pool.

_**Note:** This service is provided free, to the public, in the hopes that it might prove useful. **No warranty is provided**, nor any offer of continuing service or access._

_By using this service, you **MUST** understand that presence of data in the keyserver (pools) in no way connotes trust. Anyone can generate a key, with any name or email address, and upload it. All security and trust comes from evaluating security at the ''object level'', via PGP [Web-Of-Trust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) signatures. This keyserver makes it possible to retrieve keys, looking them up via various indices, but the collection of keys in this public pool is KNOWN to contain malicious and fraudulent keys. It is the common expectation of server operators that users understand this and use software which, like all known common OpenPGP implementations, evaluates trust accordingly. This expectation is so common that it is not normally explicitly stated._

## About the Server Pool

The main HKP pool which you should configure your keyserver software to use is **ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net**, or perhaps **pool.sks-keyservers.net**. Folks will understand and expect that choice. (Also **na.pool.sks-keyservers.net** in North America or **eu.pool.sks-keyservers.net** in Europe).

This server is running [SKS Keyserver](https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/wiki/Home).
