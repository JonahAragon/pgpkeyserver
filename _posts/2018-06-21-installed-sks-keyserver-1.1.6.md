**a.sks.jda.mn** is now live on SKS 1.1.6! More information on the underlying software can be [found here](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/sks-devel/2016-08/msg00000.html).

We are using a custom version of the **pgpkeyserver** frontend developed by Matt Rude at [mattrude/pgpkeyserver](https://github.com/mattrude/pgpkeyserver) that was forked to [jonaharagon/pgpkeyserver](https://github.com/JonahAragon/pgpkeyserver).

Thanks to Rude for his excellent [SKS setup guide](https://keyserver.mattrude.com/guides/building-server/ubuntu-16/) and frontend software!

You can contact me [following the instructions on the homepage](/#contact) if you have any questions or concerns about the operation of this server.

We are looking for fellow keyserver operators to peer with us so we can join the sks-keyservers pools! If you're willing to add us please contact me!

This server (at launch) supports IPv6, is hosted on a Gigabit link, and has 5102280 keys loaded, via a keydump from Matt Rude generated on 2018-06-21. It is located in New York.
